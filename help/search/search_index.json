Because of those platform safeguards (which also restrict some process details even for an app's own process), WhatsRunning needs a small privileged helper to gather full process information.</p> <p>Rather than bypassing the system from the app itself, WhatsRunning runs that helper as a separate, higher-privilege process. By default the helper runs under the ADB UID (2000) when started via ADB, or under the System UID (1000) on rooted devices. If you have a rooted device, you can change the helper's UID in Advanced Settings.</p>"},{"location":"faqs/#faq2","title":"My device isn't rooted. How can I use WhatsRunning?","text":"<p>Use with ADB. Please do read the note at the start. There are some limitations; more on some devices, less on others.</p>"},{"location":"faqs/#faq3","title":"Why WhatsRunning requires INTERNET permission?","text":"<p>The standalone Pro version requires internet connection for license verification. The other versions - Free and Play Store Pro - can work completely offline. Though Play Store app needs internet connection for license verification.</p> <p>Optional use of <code>android.permission.INTERNET</code> permission:</p> <ul> <li>Check for app updates. You can disable this in app settings.</li> <li>Fetch help contents of this webpage that you view in drawer \u2192 Help.</li> </ul> <p>Local (on-device) use of <code>android.permission.INTERNET</code> permission:</p> <p>Android does not allow apps to create network sockets without having the INTERNET permission even if they are meant to be used only locally and not for an internet connection. WhatsRunning has two uses of local (on-device) connections (the ability to create <code>localhost</code> sockets at <code>127.0.0.1</code>) for Inter Process Communication (IPC):</p> <ul> <li>WhatsRunning starts a background process with root / ADB privileges and talks to that process over network socket. After the initial handshake, both processes start talking over Binder. We have no better way to do this because Android doesn't allow apps to talk over UNIX domain sockets either.</li> <li>If your device is not rooted and you use WhatsRunning with ADB, then connecting to <code>adbd</code> requires internet permissions. See Is PMX spying on me using ADB over network?.</li> </ul> <p>So if the app is unable to create or use local network sockets, it will fail. And if you want to stop WhatsRunning from using internet, it must not stop the app from talking to on-device processes over loopback interface for IPC. This is usually the case with <code>iptables</code>-based firewalls like Fyrypt and VPN based firewalls like NetGuard. But some ROMs have a built-in feature to disallow network access:</p> <p></p> <p>This not only prevents the app from using internet but also disables its ability to create loopback sockets for IPC. So WhatsRunning won't be able to get root / ADB privileges if this permission is denied.</p>"},{"location":"faqs/#faq4","title":"How much privacy friendly WhatsRunning is?","text":"<p>We are not interested in you or your device at all.
